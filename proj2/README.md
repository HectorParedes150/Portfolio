  This project was completed using R in R studio. The purpose of this project was to identify which factors could be contributing to customers defaulting on their loans. This dataset had information based on whether customers defaulted on their loan or not and their loan amount, installment, interest rate, loan purpose, application type, term, home ownership, annual income, current job years, debt to income, total credit lines, years of credit history, missed payment in last 2 years, bankruptcy history, and history tax liens. 

The code is included in the report. In the report there are 6 questions asked to find relationships between customers defaulting on their loans and some of the variables in the dataset. To answer these questions, tables and visualizations were created. Then there is a logistic regression model, quadratic discriminant analysis model, and a random forest model to predict whether a customer would default on their loans. To evaluate the models a ROC curve graph, area under ROC curve, and a confusion matrix were generated. 

Libraries used: tidyverse, tidymodels, discrim,
